Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
  -Software engineering is the like designing and building of complex machine or structures but instead by using code and technology, it involves planning, 
   creating, testing, and maintaining software systems in a structured way.
  -It is important in the tech industry because it helps create better and more reliable tech products that people depend on in their daily lives.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
  -Software engineering being introduced and recognizing the need for systematic approaches to manage software complexity.
  -The focus on iterative development, flexibility, and customer collaboration, transforming software development practices.
  -Revolutionized software delivery with automation, improving deployment speed, reliability, and collaboration between development and operations teams.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
   -Requirements: Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
   -Design: Creating a detailed map of the software and include how it will look and work.
   -Implementation: Writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
   -Testing:Checking the software to make sure it works well and does not have bugs.
   -Deployment: Releasing the software to users so it can be used for the purpose it was built for. 
   -Maintainence: Keeping the software updated and fixing any issues that come up is important.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
    -Waterfall method is best suited for projects with well-defined requirements and a predictable scope, where changes are minimal.
    -Agile method is ideal for projects with evolving requirements, where flexibility and customer feedback are crucial for success.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
    -Even though the positions make up one team, they are responsible for different aspects that make up the team. Software Developers build and maintain software 
     (by writing code, debugging and code review). Quality Assurance Engineers ensure the software is tested and meets quality standards (by testing the software, 
     reporting bugs and automation). Where Project Managers coordinate and oversee the project to ensure successful completion (by planning, coordinating, 
     monitoring and making sure that everyone communicate effectively amoungst each other about the tasks that need to be completed).


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
   -IDEs provides tools needed to make coding faster and more efficient. IDEs support every phase of the software development lifecycle by providing integrated 
    tools and features that enhance productivity, streamline workflows, and ensure the quality and efficiency of the development process.
   -VCS help keep track of changes, manage different versions, support collaboration and provide backups, making it easier to handle and 
    organize projects. It is crucially important for managing code changes, facilitating collaboration, supporting testing and deployment and maintaining a 
    reliable and organized project history.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
   -Debugging, keeping up with rapid tech changes, ensuring security and meeting deadlines, just to name a few, are some of problems that Software Engineers face.
   -These problems can be overcome by allowing and asking for help when one cannot seem to find bugs, be willing to upskill and learn what other products are being 
    used in the tech industry, implementing or hiring cyber security experts to handle the security of data, asking for help when there is a lot of work to be done 
    done before the deadline. 
    

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
  -Software testing is essential for ensuring that a software application works correctly and meets the required quality standards.
  -Unit = Testing individual components/functions of the software in isolation.
  -Intergration = Testing how different components/systems work together.
  -System = Testing the complete and integrated software system to ensure it meets specified requirements.
  -Acceptance = Validating if the software to ensure it meets business requirements and is ready to be delivered to users.
  

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
  -Prompt engineering is the process of designing and refining the questions/intructions given to AI models to get the best possible responses.
  -It is crucial in interacting with AI models because it directly influences the quality and relevance of the response the AI provides. It is essential for 
   maximizing the effectiveness of AI interactions by getting precise, relevant, and useful responses, making the AI more valuable and efficient in various 
   applications

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
  - "Tell me the weather" can be improved to "Tell me what the weather is like in Cape Town today." The improved prompt is effective because I specified the day 
    and place I want to know the weather of, that way I will get a precise answer.
